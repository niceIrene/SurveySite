  <p>
      You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Yin Lin, under the supervision of Meiyappan Nagappan of the University of Waterloo, Canada. The objectives of the research study are providing software developers guidance on mobile ads usage. The study is for a Senior Honour’s thesis.
  </p>
  <p>
      If you decide to volunteer, you will be asked to complete a 10-minute online survey that is completed anonymously.  Survey questions focus on users’ preference on different mobile ads usage format.  Participation in this study is voluntary. You may decline to answer any questions that you do not wish to answer and you can withdraw your participation at any time by not submitting your responses.  There are no known or anticipated risks from participating in this study.
  </p>
    <p>
        It is important for you to know that any information that you provide will be confidential. All of the data will be summarized and no individual could be identified from these summarized results. Furthermore, the web site is programmed to collect responses alone and will not collect any information that could potentially identify you (such as machine identifiers).
    </p>
    <p>
        When information is transmitted over the internet confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. University of Waterloo practices are to turn off functions that collect machine identifiers such as IP addresses. The host of the system collecting the data powered by www.wjx.cn may collect this information without our knowledge and make this accessible to us. We will not use or save this information without your consent. If you prefer not to submit your survey responses through this host, please contact one of the researchers so you can participate using an alternative method such as through an e-mail or paper-based questionnaire. The alternate method may decrease anonymity but confidentiality will be maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data, with no personal identifiers, collected from this study will be maintained on a password-protected computer database in a restricted access area of the university. As well, the data will be electronically archived after completion of the study and maintained for two years and then erased.
    </p>
    <p>
